## Main Features

**IdeaMemo** is an Android lightweight note-taking app.

Here are the current features:

- **Privacy First** : No need to apply any permissions, all runtime data is firmly stored in your local database or can be uploaded to your own WEBDAV private cloud.
- **Simplicity and cleanliness** : Indexed by #TAG , it supports mixed text and graphics to record and organize your sudden inspirations. But as a card note, it is not recommended to record too long text.
- **Review at any time** : Support calendar view, heatmap and random walk to review your notes.
- **Code Open Source** : All code is open source on Github, you can view and collaborate on development at any time.
- **Free to use** : Enjoy all features completely free of charge with no content fees.
- **Continuously Updated** : IdeaMemo is always in use by itself and will be continuously updated.

## Thanks
This project was created by Compose. Some of the project's code is derived from excellent open-source projects.

I'll gradually improve it, but the power of one person is limited. Pull requests are welcome.
